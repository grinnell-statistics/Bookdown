<p>Statistics courses often teach the two-sample t-test, linear regression, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) as very distinct approaches to analyzing different types of data. However, this chapter makes connections among these three techniques by focusing on the statistical models. Statistical software has made it easy to calculate statistics and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values. But without understanding the underlying model assumptions, it is easy to draw incorrect conclusions from the sample data. As studies become more complex, models become fundamental to drawing appropriate conclusions. In this chapter, a simple student experiment involving games and several additional studies are used to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compare the underlying statistical models for the two-sample t-test, linear regression, and
ANOVA</li>
<li>Discuss the model assumptions for each of these three tests</li>
<li>Create and interpret normal probability plots</li>
<li>Transform data in order to better fit the model assumptions</li>
<li>Discuss the mathematical details of each hypothesis test and corresponding confidence interval</li>

</h2>
<p>In 1935, John Stroop published a paper presenting his research on the reaction time of undergraduate students identifying ink colors.2 He found that students took a longer time identifying ink colors when the ink was used to spell a different color. For example, if the word [[[“yellow”]]] was printed in blue ink, students took longer to identify the blue ink because they automatically read the word “yellow.” Even though students were told only to identify the ink color, the automatized behavior of reading interfered with the task and slowed their reaction time.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Note that many psychologists would call this procedural knowledge instead of automatized behavior. Both are processes that can be done without conscious thought, but automatized behaviors are processes that cannot be slowed down, do not
decline with age, and show no gender differences.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> <em>Automatized behaviors</em> are behaviors that can be done automatically without carefully thinking through each step in the process. Stroop’s work, demonstrating that automatized behaviors can act as a distracter for other desired behaviors, is so well known that the effect is often called the <em>Stroop effect</em>.</p>
<p>Several students in an introductory statistics class wanted to develop a final project that would test the impact of distracters. They decided to conduct a study to determine if students at their college would perform differently when a distracting color was incorporated into a computerized game. This game challenges people to place an assortment of shaped pegs into the appropriate spaces as quickly as possible. Before any data were collected, these students developed a clear set of procedures.</p>
<ul>
<li>40 students would be randomly selected from the college.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Since it was not possible to force college students to be involved in this study, these researchers randomly selected students from an online college directory until they had 40 students who were willing to play the game.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a>
</li>
<li>20 students would be assigned to the standard game and 20 would be assigned to a game with a color
distracter. The student researchers would flip a coin to randomly assign subjects to a treatment. Once
20 subjects had been assigned to either group, the rest would automatically be assigned to play the
other game.</li>
<li>Subjects would see a picture of the game and have the rules clearly explained to them before they
played the game. An example of both games is shown in Figure 2.1.</li>
<li>Subjects would play the game in the same area with similar background noise to control for other
possible distractions.</li>
<li>The response variable would be the time in seconds from when the participant pressed the “start
game” button to when he or she won the game.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>
It is important to recognize that each subject in this study was assigned to exactly one treatment, either the standard game or the color distracter game. Some researchers may point out that a paired design (where each subject was assigned to both treatments) might have been more efficient. However, for the purposes of this chapter, this study will be treated as the students originally designed it: a study comparing two independent samples.</p>

</h3>
<p>Generally, <strong>statistical models</strong> have the following form:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
observed value = mean response + random error
</p>
<p>The statistical model describes each observed value in a data set as the sum of a mean response for some subgroup of interest (often called a group mean) and a random error term. The mean response is fixed for each group, while the random error term is used to model the uncertainty of each individual outcome. The random error term for each individual outcome cannot be predicted, but in the long run there is a regular pattern that can be modeled with a distribution (such as the normal distribution).</p>
<p>The key question in this study is whether or not the two types of games have different average completion times. The two-sample t-test starts with the assumption that the two group means are equal. This is often written as the null hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0\)</span> or, equivalently, <span class="math inline">\(H_0 : \mu_1 = \mu_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>The underlying model used in the two-sample t-test is designed to account for these two group means (<span class="math inline">\(\mu_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2\)</span>) and random error. The statistical model for the first population, the color distracter group, is:</p>
<p>[[[Eq 2.1]]]</p>
<p>where j is used to represent each observation in the sample from the first population. For example, <span class="math inline">\(y_{1, 9}\)</span> represents the 9th observation in the first group (the color distracter group). In this data set, there were 20 observations taken from the first population; thus, <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> = 20.</p>
<p>This model states that the color distracter game is expected to be centered at the constant value <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1\)</span> . In addition, each observation is expected to have some variability (random error) that is typically modeled by a normal distribution with a mean equal to zero and a fixed variance s2. Similarly, each observation from the second group, the standard game, can be modeled as the sum of <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2\)</span> plus a random error term, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{2, j}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(y_{2, j} = \mu_2 + \epsilon_{2, j}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(j = 1, 2, ... ,n_2\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(n_2 = 20\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2\)</span> is the mean of the standard group, and the <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{2, j}\)</span> are random variables (typically from a
normal distribution) with a mean equal to zero and variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> . Often, this statistical model is more succinctly written as:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(y_{i, j} = \mu_i + \epsilon_{i, j}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(j = 1, 2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j = 1, 2, ... ,n_2\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{i, j} \sim N(0,\sigma^2)\)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>MATHMATICAL NOTE</strong>
You may recall from your introductory statistics course that adding a constant to each random variable in a population does not change the shape or spread of the population. Since each mean response (<span class="math inline">\(\mu_i\)</span>) is fixed (i.e., a constant value), Equation (2.1) can be used to show that <span class="math inline">\(y_{i, j} \sim N(\mu_i,\sigma^2)\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This model has one assumption that you may not have made when previously conducting a two-sample t-test. Equation (2.1) states that all <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{i, j}\)</span> come from a normally distributed population with a mean of zero and
variance s2 . This is called the equal variance assumption. Some introductory statistics courses discuss only a two-sample t-test that does not require the equal variance assumption. The equal variance assumption is
made here because it makes sense for this experiment, the data support it (<span class="math inline">\(s_1\)</span> is close to <span class="math inline">\(s_2\)</span>), and it allows a direct comparison to ANOVA and regression models.</p>
<p>In Equation (2.1), the mean response of the model is the population mean (<span class="math inline">\(\mu_1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2\)</span>). Just as a sample mean, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}_i\)</span>, is used to estimate the population means, <span class="math inline">\(\mu_i\)</span>, residuals are used to estimate the random error terms. <strong>Residuals</strong> are the difference between the observed response and the estimated mean response. For example, the random error term <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{1, 12} = + \bar{y}_{1, 12} - \mu_1\)</span> is estimated by <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\epsilon}_{1, 12} = + \bar{y}_{1, 12} - \bar{y}_1\)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>
A <strong>statistic</strong> is any mathematical function of the sample data. <strong>Parameters</strong> are actual population values that cannot be known unless the entire population is sampled. The mean response is based on population parameters. If a sample data set is used, we do not know the population parameters. Sample statistics (such as the sample mean, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}\)</span>, and the sample standard deviation, <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>) are used to estimate population parameters (<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>). Statisticians often use a hat on top of a parameter to represent an estimate of that parameter. For example, an estimate of the population standard deviation is written <span class="math inline">\(s = \hat{\sigma}\)</span> , and an estimate for a mean is written <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}_1 = \hat{\mu}_1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}_2 = \hat{\mu}_2\)</span>.</p>

</h3>
<p>Several implicit assumptions are built into the model for the two-sample t-test shown in Equation (2.1):</p>
<ul>
<li>Constant parameters: The population values in this model (<span class="math inline">\(\mu_1\)</span> , <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2\)</span> , and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>) do not change throughout the study.</li>
<li>Additive terms: The model described in Equation (2.1) shows that the observed responses are the sum of our parameters and error terms. For example, we are not considering models such as
<span class="math inline">\(y_{i, j} = \mu_i * \epsilon_{i, j}\)</span> .</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{i, j} \sim N(0,\sigma^2)\)</span>. This assumption has many key components:</li>
<li>The error terms are independent and identically distributed (iid).</li>
<li>The error terms follow a normal probability distribution.</li>
<li>The error terms have a mean of zero. This implies that the average of several observed values will tend to be close to the true mean. In essence, there is no systematic bias in the error terms.</li>
<li>The population variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> is the same for both groups (color distracter and standard games) being tested.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first assumption tells us about the mean response. The parameter estimate (<span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}_i\)</span>) would not be meaningful if the true parameter value (<span class="math inline">\(\mu_i\)</span>) were not constant throughout the study. The second assumption simply states the types of models we are building. In later chapters with more complex models, we will discuss how to use residual plots to determine if the model is appropriate. In this chapter, we will focus on the assumptions about the error terms</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>MATHMATICAL NOTE</strong>
In later chapters, we will show that a curved pattern in a residual versus fit plot suggests that an additive model may not be appropriate. In this example, there are only two fitted values (i.e., expected values), so we cannot see any curved patterns. When the additive assumption is violated, residual plots may also indicate different standard deviations, a nonnormal distribution, or lack of independence. Transforming the data to a new scale can often make the additivity assumption (and several of the other assumptions) more appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statistical model described in Equation (2.1) assumes that <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{i, j}\)</span> are modeled as <strong>independent and identically distributed</strong> (iid) random variables. The independent error term assumption states that there is no relationship between one observation and the next. For example, knowing that the 8th subject in a group played the game more quickly than average does not provide any information about whether the 7th or 9th person in the group will be above or below the average.</p>
<p>The identically distributed assumption states that each error is assumed to come from the same population distribution. Thus, each subject from a particular group is from the same population. If any error term
based on a particular observation comes from a different population, the two-sample t-test will not be valid. For example, elementary school students may have different expected completion times for the Shapesplosion game than college students. It would be inappropriate to include younger students in a study where the population was assumed to be college students</p>
<p>Model assumptions for the residuals should always be checked with plots of the data. The extended activities will describe normality tests in more detail, but in most situations a simple graph of the residuals will
suffice. The two sample t-test actually requires only that the sample means (each <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}_{i,j}\)</span>) be normally distributed. The central limit theorem allows us to assume this is true if group sample sizes are similar and large (<span class="math inline">\(n_1 \ge 15\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_2 \ge 15\)</span>) and there does not appear to be any extreme skewness or outliers in the residuals.</p>
<p>Since residuals are defined as the difference between each observed value and the corresponding group mean, they should always sum to zero. Thus, we cannot check residuals to determine whether each of the error
terms is centered at zero. The assumption that the error terms are centered at zero is really stating that there are no other sources of variability that may be biasing our results. In essence, the only difference between the two population means is explained by the mean response.</p>
<p>To check the assumption that the two populations have the same variance, an informal test can be used. If the ratio of the sample standard deviations is less than 2, we can proceed with the analysis.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Some texts suggest rejecting the equal variance assumption when the ratio is greater than 3 instead of 2. If the ratio is close to 2 (or 3), many statisticians would suggest conducting a more formal F-test for equal variances.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Informal Test for Equal Variances</strong></p>
<p>[[[ ]]]</p>
<p>then we do not have enough evidence to conclude that the population variances are different.</p>
<p>Several key observations should be made about the individual value plot shown in Figure 2.2:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mean completion time is higher for the color distracter group than for the standard group.</li>

<p>The simple linear regression model discussed in introductory statistics courses typically has the followingcform:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon_i ~\text{ for } i = 1, 2, ... , n ~\text{ where } \epsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2)
\tag{2.2}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>[[[add eq number (2.2)]]]</p>
<p>A <strong>simple linear regression</strong> model is a straight-line regression model with a single explanatory variable and a single response variable. For this linear regression model, the mean response (<span class="math inline">\(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_i\)</span>) is a function of two parameters, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>, and an explanatory variable, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. The random error terms, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span>, are assumed to be independent and to follow a normal distribution with mean zero and variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>In Equation (2.1), we used double subscripts: <span class="math inline">\(i = 1, 2\)</span> was used to show that there were two distinct groups and <span class="math inline">\(j = 1, 2, ... , n_i\)</span> was used to identify each of the <span class="math inline">\(n_1 = n_2 = 20\)</span> items within the two groups. In the regression model, there is only one set of subscripts: <span class="math inline">\(i = 1, 2, ..., n\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(n = 40 = n_1 + n_2\)</span>. Instead of having two distinct means in the model (<span class="math inline">\(\mu_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2\)</span>), as in the two-sample t-test, we have one regression model where the parameters, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>, are fixed. The categorical explanatory variable, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, indicates game type.</p>
<p>A procedure commonly used to incorporate categorical explanatory variables, such as the game type, into a regression model is to define <strong>indicator variables</strong>, also called <strong>dummy variables</strong>, that will take on the role of the x variable in the model. Creating dummy variables is a process of mapping the column of categorical data into 0 and 1 data. For example, the indicator variable will have the value 1 for every observation from the color distracter game and 0 for every observation from the standard game. Most statistical software packages have a command for automatically creating dummy variables.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>
Typically an indicator variable is created for each category. Thus, there would be an indicator variable called Color equal to 1 for the color distracter game and 0 otherwise and another indicator variable called Standard equal to 1 for the standard game and 0 for all other categories. Notice that there is complete redundancy between the two indicator variables: Knowing the value of the Color variable automatically tells us the value of the Standard variable for each subject. Thus, only one of the indicator variables is needed in this model. Although this study has only two categories of games (color and standard), it is common for a categorical explanatory variable to have more than two categories. Chapter 3 provides the opportunity to use indicator variables when there are multiple categories.</p>

Details for calculating these statistics by hand are provided in the extended activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat the two previous questions, but use an indicator variable where <span class="math inline">\(x = 1\)</span> represents the standard game and <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span> represents the color distracter game.

When there are only two categories (color distracter and standard), does the choice of indicator variable impact your conclusions? Why or why not?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the previous questions, we assigned <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to be the dummy variable that indicates the type of game. Notice that the mean response is still a constant (nonrandom) value for each of the two game categories. In other
words, when <span class="math inline">\(x = 1\)</span> the mean response is a fixed value, and when <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span> the mean response is a fixed value. In addition, the “slope” coefficient (<span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>) can be considered as an estimate of the average amount by which the response variable will change from the standard game (<span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span>) to the color distracter game (<span class="math inline">\(x = 1\)</span>).</p>
<p>Although the notation has changed, the regression model and the model used in the two-sample t-test are mathematically equivalent. When a subject is from the color distracter group, the mean response is <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1\)</span> in the t-test and the mean response sets <span class="math inline">\(x = 1\)</span> in the regression model. Thus,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 = \beta_0 + \beta_1(1) = \beta_0 + \beta_1\)</span><br>
[[[add eq(2.3)]]]</p>
<p>When a subject is from the standard group, the mean response is <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2\)</span> in the t-test and the mean response sets <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span> in regression. Thus,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\mu_2 = \beta_0 + \beta_1(0) = \beta_0\)</span><br>
[[[add eq(2.4)]]]</p>
<p>Equations (2.3) and (2.4) can be combined to show the relationship between the two-sample t-test and regression hypotheses.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 - \mu_2 = (\beta_0 + \beta_1) - \beta_0 = \beta_1\)</span>
[[[eq (2.5)]]]</p>
<p>Thus, stating that <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0\)</span> is equivalent to stating that <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 = 0\)</span></p>

<p><strong>Key Concept</strong>
In testing the difference in two population means, testing the null hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0 : \beta_1 = 0\)</span> for a regression model is equivalent to testing the two-sample t-test hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0\)</span> <em>when using the equal variance assumption</em>.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Model Assumptions for Regression<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#model-assumptions-for-regression"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>While no distributional assumptions are needed to create estimates of b0 and b1 , it is necessary to check the same model assumptions when conducting a hypothesis test for b1. Just as in the two-sample t-test, the model assumes that the parameters b0 , b1 , and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> are constant. In addition, Equation (2.2) shows that our model consists of the mean response plus the error term. The regression model also assumes that <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2)\)</span>.</p>
<p>This expression represents the following four assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The error terms are independent and identically distributed (iid).</li>
<li>The error terms follow a normal probability distribution.</li>
<li>The error terms have a mean of zero .</li>
<li>The error terms in the regression model are assumed to come from a single population with variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> (i.e., the variance does not depend on <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>).</li>
</ul>
<p>In regression, assumptions about the error terms are also checked by residual plots. Here, <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> represents each observed response and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}_i = b_0 + b_1x_i\)</span> represents the estimated mean response. So the residuals are simply the observed value minus the estimated value: <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\epsilon}_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i\)</span></p>
<p>Figure 2.3 shows a histogram of the residuals and a plot of the residuals by type of game. The histogram shows that the residuals approximately follow the shape of a normal distribution. The residual versus game type graph shows that there are no obvious outliers and that the spread of both groups is roughly equivalent. Since residuals are just the mean response subtracted from the observed value, the center of the residual plots has shifted to zero. However, the spread of the residual versus game plot is identical to the spread of the individual value plot in Figure 2.2.</p>
<p>[[[Fig 2.3]]]

<p><strong>Key Concept</strong>
No assumptions are needed about the error terms to calculate estimates (<span class="math inline">\(b_1 = \hat{\beta}_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_0 = \hat{\beta}_0\)</span>) of the slope and intercept of the regression line. These estimates are simply well-known mathematical calculations.
