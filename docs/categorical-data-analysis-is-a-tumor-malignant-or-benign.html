<p><em>It is commonly believed that anyone who tabulates numbers is a statistician. This is like believing that anyone who owns a scalpel is a surgeon.</em>
—Robert Hooke1</p>
<p>This chapter introduces inference techniques for data in which both the explanatory and
response variables are categorical. The term categorical data analysis often refers to
analysis of data in which the response variable is categorical. However, in this chapter
we will restrict our focus to cases where both the explanatory and the response variables are
categorical and where there is no natural ordering to the categories.</p>
<p>Most of the hypothesis tests discussed in previous chapters use the normal distribution to
model the mean response. In this chapter, proportions, odds ratios, and relative risk will be
used to summarize categorical data. We will start by looking at cancer cell data to determine
if there is a relationship between the shape of the cell nuclei and the proportion of malignant
cells. In this chapter, we will discuss how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct a simulation study, chi-square test, and Fisher’s exact test</li>
<li>Calculate and properly interpret summary statistics such as relative risk and the odds ratio</li>
<li>Determine which test to use based on various sampling schemes and questions of interest</li>
</ul>

<p>Cancer is a disease that occurs when abnormal cells grow in the body. When DNA (a substance in every
cell) is damaged, normal cells will often repair the damaged DNA. Cancer cells are cells in which the
DNA is not repaired. DNA can be damaged by many things, including viruses, tobacco smoke, alcohol,
and too much sunlight. Cells with damaged DNA can also be inherited. Cancer cells can continue to grow
and divide and usually form tumors (a lump or mass) somewhere in the body. Cancer cells can also outlive
It is important to note that not all tumors are cancerous. If a lump is detected, part of it can be removed
surgically and a biopsy conducted to determine if the mass is benign or malignant. Benign tumors are scar
tissue or abnormal growths that do not spread and are typically harmless. Malignant (or invasive) cancer
cells are cells that can travel, typically through the bloodstream or lymph nodes, and begin to replace normal
cells in other parts of the body. If a tumor is malignant, it is essential to remove or destroy all cancerous cells
in order to keep them from spreading. If a tumor is benign, surgery is typically not needed and the harmless
tumor can remain.</p>
<p>A biopsy requires surgery to remove a section (or all) of the tumor and will leave a scar. Fine needle
aspiration (FNA) is a technique in which a small sample of the tumor is taken using a needle and visually
inspected through a microscope. Since many tumors are benign, it is often preferable to have an FNA, which
is less invasive and less traumatic than a biopsy.</p>
<p>Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States. The
American Cancer Society estimated that, in the United States in 2010, 39,840 women and 390 men died from
breast cancer and 207,090 women were diagnosed with breast cancer.2 This type of cancer is often detected
by finding a lump (or mass) in the breast.</p>
<p>Wolberg and Mangasarian developed a technique to accurately diagnose breast masses using only visual
characteristics of the cells within the tumor.3 This system is used at University of Wisconsin hospitals to assist
doctors in diagnosis of breast cancer.4 Each FNA sample is placed on a slide, and characteristics of the cellular
nuclei within the tumor are examined under a microscope. Several measurements, such as size, shape, and
texture, are collected for each of the nuclei visible on the slide, and then an algorithm is used to determine the
likelihood that a mass is benign or malignant.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will focus on just a few characteristics from a relatively small data set that was col-
lected at University of Wisconsin hospitals in Madison. We will start by determining if the shape of a cell
nucleus can help us to determine whether a tumor is malignant or benign.
Typically, healthy cell nuclei have round or ellipsoid shapes.Figure 6.1 shows a sample of malignant cells that appear to have grown such that the perimeters of the cell nuclei have somewhat concave points.</p>

<p>Table 6.1 shows data from 37 FNA slide samples. Slides with smooth ellipsoid-shaped nuclei were classified
as round, and slides with poorly shaped cell nuclei were classified as concave. A biopsy was also conducted
on each of these samples to determine if each was malignant or benign.</p>
<p>In Table 6.1, both the variables are categorical. A <strong>categorical variable</strong> is one for which the measurement
consists of categories, such as college major, political affiliation, personality type, gender, or pass/fail grade.
When a variable is categorical, each subject or unit must fit in one and only one category. A <strong>binary variable</strong>
is a special type of categorical variable that has just two possible categories.</p>
<p>Summarizing quantitative data such as age, weight, and income often includes calculating the mean value.
However, Table 6.1 cannot be used to calculate the mean Shape or mean Type value. Since these categorical
variables have no ordinal or interval meaning, it is not appropriate to focus on the mean response; rather, we
focus on the proportion (or percent) of responses that fall into each category.</p>
<p>A table that counts the number of observations in each group, such as Table 6.1, is called a <strong>contingency table</strong> (or cross-tabulation table). A contingency table with two variables is called a <strong>two-way contingency table</strong>. Table 6.1 is also called a <strong>2 x 2 table</strong>, since there are two row groups and two column groups. In Table
6.1, the Shape of the cell is called the <strong>row variable</strong>, since each horizontal row represents one shape group.
Similarly, the Type of the cell is called the <strong>column variable</strong>.</p>
<p>
Categorical data that have a natural ordering, such as level of agreement (strongly disagree, disagree,
indifferent, agree, strongly agree) or evaluation of a product (poor, fair, good, or excellent), are called
<strong>ordinal data</strong>. Categorical data that do not have a natural ordering, such as gender or major, are called
<strong>nominal data</strong>. Techniques for nominal data will give identical results for any ordering of the categories,
whereas results based on techniques for ordinal data do depend on the ordering of the data. This chapter
is restricted to examples of nominal data analysis techniques.

<p>Bar graphs are often useful in comparing two categorical variables. Figure 6.1 shows a <strong>segmented bar graph</strong> (also called a stacked bar graph) for the cancer cell data. This graph shows the conditional percentages
for each nucleus shape. About 80% of the concave nuclei are malignant, whereas about 45% of the round

</h2>
<p>Figure 6.2 shows that our sample of 37 slides indicates a relationship between the shape of the cell nuclei and malignancy. However, statistical inference is needed to draw conclusions about the entire population from which these samples were selected. In this section, we will conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the sample data provide evidence that the proportion of malignant cells is greater for concave nuclei than for round nuclei.</p>
<p>The hypothesis test in this example is one-sided because we have a medical reason to suspect that concave nuclei are more likely to be malignant. For this example, the null and alternative hypotheses can be written as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
H_0: p_C = p_R \quad\text{vs.}\quad H_a: p_C &gt; p_R
\tag{6.1}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(p_C\)</span> is the true proportion of concave nuclei that are malignant and <span class="math inline">\(p_R\)</span> is the true proportion of round nuclei that are malignant.</p>
<p>If the null hypothesis, <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>, is true, the two populations (of concave and round cells) have the same proportion of malignant cells and the observed difference between round and concave cells in our sample is due simply to the random sampling process. In other words, the samples just randomly happened to have more malignant cells in the concave nucleus population than in the round nucleus group.</p>
<p>The <strong><span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value</strong> for this test is the probability of obtaining a difference in sample proportions (<span class="math inline">\(\hat p_C - \hat p_R\)</span>) as large as or larger than the one observed in this sample when the null hypothesis is true. If the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value is small, it is unlikely that the null hypothesis is true and we conclude that the alternative hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(p_C &gt; p_R\)</span>) is true.</p>
<p>One way to estimate this <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value is to simulate taking samples many times under the following three conditions:</p>
<p>• Assume that malignancy is unrelated to cell nucleus shape (i.e., assume that both cell nucleus shapes have the same proportion of malignant cells).<br>
• A total of 13 benign and 24 malignant cells were observed.<br>
• A total of 16 round cell nuclei and 21 concave cell nuclei were observed.</p>

<li>Repeat the simulation process in Question 4 nine more times. Does it seem likely that 17 or more

</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>While simulations can be done by hand with cards, this process is very time consuming, as a large number
of simulations are needed to get a true feel for the likelihood of an outcome (many statisticians suggest
10,000 simulations). Instead of repeating the above process 10,000 times by hand, we will use a computer
program to conduct a simulation.</p>

<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Use the technology instructions provided on the CD to conduct one simulation. In this simulation, you
should have one column listing 24 malignant and 13 benign cells. Randomly select 21 rows to represent

<li>Repeat the computer simulation process in Question 6 nine more times, each time recording the num-
ber of malignant cells you sampled in the concave nucleus group. How does this simulation compare to
your index card simulation? Would you expect to get exactly the same number of samples with 17 or
more malignant cells? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Use the software instructions to repeat the computer-simulated randomization process a total of 10,000
times. Create a histogram of the 10,000 simulated counts in the concave malignant group. Estimate the
p-value by dividing the number of counts greater than or equal to 17 by 10,000.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Table 6.2 shows 10,000 simulated trials, based on Question 8. This simulation had 220 observations
greater than or equal to 17, providing a p-value of <span class="math inline">\(P(X \geq 17)= 0.022\)</span>, where X is the number of concave
malignant cells. Thus, we can conclude that if the null hypothesis were true (the proportion of malignant cells
was the same for cells with round and concave nuclei), the likelihood of finding 17 or more malignant cells
out of the 21 cells with concave nuclei would be approximately 220 out of 10,000. This small p-value shows
that the difference in our sample proportions is so large that it is unlikely to have occurred by chance. Thus,
we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that cells with concave nuclei are more likely to be malignant than
cells with round nuclei.</p>
<p>Using simulations to approximate p-values has many advantages. Often simple programs or mac-
ros can be written to quickly simulate thousands of samples. Computer programs can be modified to
fit a variety of situations, while parametric tests with theoretical assumptions can be somewhat rigid
and require large sample sizes. Simulations only provide approximate p-values. However, increasing
the number of simulations improves the precision of the p-value; 10,000 simulations usually provides
precise p-values.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> <strong>Fisher’s Exact Test</strong><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#fishers-exact-test"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>While the use of simulations to determine <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values is quickly gaining in popularity, sometimes the exact <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value can be calculated based on an appropriate probability model. <strong>Fisher’s exact test</strong> uses the <strong>hypergeometric distribution</strong> to calculate exact probabilities.</p>
<p>Just as in the simulation study, we are interested in testing <span class="math inline">\(H_0: p_C = p_R\)</span> vs. <span class="math inline">\(H_a: p_C &gt; p_R\)</span>. In addition, we use the same three assumptions to find the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value, the probability that 17 or more of the malignant cells occur in the concave nucleus group when <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is true. Table 6.3 provides the same data as Table 6.1, but notation has been included to extend this test to any 2 × 2 table.</p>
<p>In any 2 × 2 table, there are a total of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> observations that can be classified as either a success or a failure. <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> represents the number of success, and thus <span class="math inline">\(N - M\)</span> is the number of failures. We are interesting in finding the probability of observing <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> successes in a random selection of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> observations. For the cancer cell data in</p>
<p>Table 6.3, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> represents the event of interest (observing 17 concave malignant cells), <span class="math inline">\(N = 37\)</span> represents the total number of observations, <span class="math inline">\(M = 24\)</span> is the total number of malignant cells (number of successes), and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the total number of observations in the concave group.</p>
<p><br>
In this section, we simply discuss how to conduct Fisher’s exact test with statistical software. The extended activities shows that Fisher’s exact test uses the hypergeometric distribution to calculate exact <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values. For any 2 × 2 contingency table when there are <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> total observations with <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> total successes, the probability of observing <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> successes, <span class="math inline">\(P(X = x)\)</span>, in a sample of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is

<p>Both the simulation in Section 6.3 and Fisher’s exact test can be considered permutation tests. The simu-
lation study provides an approximation to Fisher’s exact test. Fisher’s exact test provides a <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value for this
problem of <span class="math inline">\(P(X \geq 17)= 0.0225\)</span>. If there truly were no difference between the likelihood of malignancy for
the two nucleus shapes (which would mean the null hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> was true), random sampling would produce
this outcome (17 or more malignant cells in the concave group) 2.25% of the time. This small probability
provides evidence that <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> should be rejected.</p>

Fisher’s exact test and the corresponding simulation study were derived here using a rather strong assump-
tion about the null hypothesis. Both tests were completed under the assumption that we had observed 13
benign and 24 malignant cells and that these totals would be the same in every randomization. Statisti-
cians call this a <strong>conditional test of independence</strong>. In other words, both the row and the column totals
are known (fixed) before the study is conducted. However, the extended activities will show that Fisher’s
exact test can be used for any 2 <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> 2 table, even when the margin totals are not fixed.<span class="math inline">\(^5\)</span>
</p>
<p>
Fisher’s exact test uses the hypergeometric distribution to provide exact p-values even for small sample sizes and succes/failure proportions near 0% or 100%

<p>In Fisher’s exact test and the simulation study, 17 or more concave malignant cells corresponded to a difference in sample proportions of <span class="math inline">\(\hat p_C - \hat p_R = 0.8095 - 0.4375 = 0.372\)</span> or more. The <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value was the probability of calculating a sample statistic <em>greater than or equal to</em> <span class="math inline">\(\hat p_C - \hat p_R = 0.372\)</span> given that <span class="math inline">\(p_C = p_R\)</span>.</p>
<p>Before this sample was collected, the researchers had medical reasons to believe that the cells with concave nuclei (i.e., the malformed nuclei) might be more likely to be malignant. If there had been no specific reasoning to justify a one-sided hypothesis, a two-sided hypothesis test would have been more appropriate:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
H_0: p_C = p_R \quad\text{vs.}\quad H_a: p_C \neq p_R
\tag{6.2}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value for a two-sided hypothesis is the probability of calculating a sample statistic <em>at least as extreme as</em> <span class="math inline">\(\hat p_C - \hat p_R = 0.372\)</span> given that <span class="math inline">\(p_C = p_R\)</span>. That is, if the null hypothesis is true, what is the probability that <span class="math inline">\(\hat p_C - \hat p_R \ge 0.372\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\hat p_C - \hat p_R \le -0.372\)</span>.</p>
<p>Question 14 helps to show that the difference in proportions, <span class="math inline">\(\hat p_C - \hat p_R \le -0.372\)</span>, corresponds to 10 or fewer concave malignant cells. Table 6.2 can then be used to calculate the approximate <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value for the two-sided hypothesis test:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\text{p-value}
&amp;= P(\hat p_C - \hat p_R \le -0.372) + P(\hat p_C - \hat p_R \ge 0.372) \notag \\ \notag
&amp;= P(X \le 10) + P(X \ge 17) \\ \notag
&amp;= \frac{1 + 8 + 118 + 197 + 21 + 2}{10{,}000} \\ \notag
&amp;= 0.0347 \notag
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>Based on this simulation, the two-sided hypothesis test should reject the null hypothesis and conclude that <span class="math inline">\(p_C \neq p_R\)</span>.</p>

</h2>
<p>Fisher’s exact test has the advantage of providing exact p-values. Before technology was available to provide
quick and easy ways to conduct Fisher’s exact test and simulation studies, the chi-square test was typically
used.</p>
<p>You may recall from previous statistics courses that the chi-square test requires that certain assumptions
be met before any analysis is done. For example, large sample sizes are needed, especially if the proportion
of successes in either group is close to 0% or 100%. If the sample size is large enough, the distribution of the
chi-square test statistic will resemble the chi-square distribution.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses:</strong></p>
<p>The null and alternative hypotheses can be written in exactly the same terms as for the two-sided per-
mutation test:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
H_0: p_C &amp;= p_R \quad\text{vs.}\quad H_a: p_C \neq p_R
\notag
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>The null hypothesis is equivalent to stating that the distributions (of malignant cells) are the same
across all groups of nucleus shapes. This test is often called a test of homogeneity.</p>
<p>
Some texts suggest using the chi-square test for homogeneity if separate samples are selected from
more than one population and using the chi-square test for independence when data are collected from
a single sample. Even though this study is based on one sample of 37 slides, the extended activities will
show that both the test of homogeneity and the test of independence are appropriate. The calculations
for both tests are identical; however, the hypotheses and conclusions are different. We choose to present
the test of homogeneity in this section so that the hypotheses and conclusions coincide with those for the
two-sided permutation tests.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Calculate the test statistic:</strong></p>
<p>The chi-square test statistic is a measure of the difference between the observed counts in Table 6.1
and the expected counts that are calculated under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true (shown
in Table 6.4).</p>
<p>In this study, 7 out of the 16 round nuclei were malignant (<span class="math inline">\(\hat p_R = 7/16= 0.4375\)</span>) and 17 out of the
21 concave nuclei were malignant (<span class="math inline">\(\hat p_C = 17/21= 0.8095\)</span>). Assuming that the proportion of malignant
cells is the same for both nucleus shapes, the best estimate of the overall proportion of cells that are
malignant is <span class="math inline">\((7 + 17)/(16 + 21)= 24/37= 0.64865\)</span>.</p>
<p>Each expected cell count is calculated by multiplying the estimated proportion times the
­appropriate sample size (the total number of concave nuclei or total number of round nuclei).
There are 16 round nuclei in our study, so the expected count of round malignant cell nuclei is
<span class="math inline">\(16(24/37)= 10.38\)</span>. In general, the expected counts are calculated as row total <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> column total/
overall total.</p>
</div>
<div id="activity-calculating-expected-counts" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Activity: Calculating Expected Counts<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#activity-calculating-expected-counts"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>

<ol start="17" style="list-style-type: decimal">

</li>
<li>Assuming the null hypothesis is true, what is the estimated proportion of benign cells in the population? If you select a sample with 16 round cells, what is the expected count of round benign cells?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Table 6.4 shows a table of expected counts under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true: the different cell nucleus shapes have the same proportion of malignant cells. Where:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\text{expected count} \;=\; \frac{\text{row total} \times \text{column total}}{\text{overall total}}.
\notag
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
10.38 = \frac{16 \times 24}{37}, \notag
\quad
5.62 = \frac{16 \times 13}{37}. \notag
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p><br>
In a chi-square test, the expected counts are calculated from the totals of the observed data. Totals in the table of observed counts (like Table 6.1) and the table of expected values (like Table 6.4) are identical, except for possible round-off error.<br></p>
<p>The chi-square test statistic is calculated to measure if the observed data are consistent with the null
hypothesis. The chi-square statistic is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(\text{observed count} - \text{expected count})^2}{\text{expected count}}
\tag{6.3}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>This statistic is the sum of each squared difference between the observed count and the expected count,
weighted by the expected count. The <em>observed count</em> represents the observed cell count from Table 6.1, and
the <em>expected count</em> represents the expected cell count from Table 6.4.</p>
<p>The chi-square statistic for the cancer cell study is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\chi^2
&amp;= \frac{(9 - 5.62)^2}{5.62} + \frac{(7 - 10.38)^2}{10.38} + \frac{(4 - 7.38)^2}{7.38} + \frac{(17 - 13.62)^2}{13.62} \\[6pt] \notag
&amp;= 2.03 + 1.10 + 1.55 + 0.84 = 5.52 \notag
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>The chi-square test statistic is always positive. If the observed and expected counts are identical, then
the test statistic <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2 = 0\)</span>. If the observed data are far from the expected data, the test statistic will be large
and the null hypothesis will be rejected. The chi-square test is not used to show that one proportion is greater
or less than another proportion, but to show that the proportions are not equal. Thus, the chi-square test is a
two-sided test.</p>
<p>
The chi-square test can be extended to categorical data with more than two rows and more than two col-
umns. Notice that the table of expected values and the chi-square test statistic in Equation (6.3) can be
calculated with additional rows and columns
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Calculate the <em>p</em>-value:</strong>
The p-value will help us determine if a test statistic of <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2 = 5.52\)</span> or larger is likely to occur by chance. If
the null hypothesis is true, the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> test statistic will follow a chi-square distribution where the degrees of
freedom are calculated as (number of rows - 1) <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> (number of columns - 1). In the cancer cell study,
there are two rows of data (round and concave) and two columns of data (benign and malignant); thus,
the test statistic has <span class="math inline">\((2- 1) \times (2- 1) = 1\)</span> degree of freedom.</p>

</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Step 4: Check model assumptions:</strong></p>
<p>Just like most hypothesis tests, the chi-square test requires that each observation be independent. In addition, the chi-square test requires a large enough sample size in each of the cells to ensure that the test statistic can be accurately represented by the chi-square distribution. Some statisticians have slightly different technical assumptions for the sample size needed, but here are two general rules:<br>
• For 2 × 2 contingency tables, the sample size should be large enough that the expected count in each of the 2 × 2 cells in the table is at least 5.<br>
• For tables with more than two rows or two columns, all expected counts should be greater than 1 and the average expected count should be greater than or equal to 5.</p>
<p>In the cancer cell study, all the expected counts are greater than 5, so it is appropriate to use the chi-square test.</p>
<p><br>
In this example, some of the expected counts are just slightly greater than 5. In this case, some texts might suggest using a chi-square test with a continuity correction. However, simulation studies and Fisher’s exact test can now be easily calculated with computers and provide more accurate p-values. Thus, there really is no longer a need to use a chi-square continuity correction to estimate the p-value.<br></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Draw conclusions within the context of the study:</strong></p>
<p>The chi-square test provides a p-value of 0.019 for the cancer cell study. This indicates that we should reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. Thus, the chi-square test leads to the same conclusion as the two-sided simulated permutation test and the two-sided Fisher’s exact test: Each nucleus shape has a different proportion of malignant cells.</p>
<p>The p-value of 0.019 for the chi-square test is somewhat close to the result of the simulation study conducted in Section 6.3, where we found a two-sided p-value of 0.0347. Every person conducting a chi-square test on the data in Table 6.1 should get the same p-value, while each simulation study will provide a slightly different p-value. Many students mistakenly assume that the variation in the p-value for the simulation study indicates that it is less accurate than the p-value for the chi-square test. But, in fact, the simulation study is more accurate than the chi-square test. Fisher’s exact test shows that the two-sided hypothesis test for the cancer cell study has an exact p-value of 0.0357. With larger sample sizes, the p-values for chi-square tests will be closer to the exact p-values.</p>

</h2>
<p>The cancer cell data in Table 6.1 were analyzed with a simulation study (more specifically, a permutation test), a chi-square test, and Fisher’s exact test. All tests suggested that the null hypothesis should be rejected, and thus we conclude that concave and round cell nuclei are associated with different proportions of malignant cells.</p>
<p>This study was not an experiment, since there was no random allocation of units to particular conditions. Thus, while we expect that there is an association between nucleus shape and malignancy, we cannot conclude that nucleus shape <em>causes</em> different proportions of malignancy.</p>
<p>The individuals who provided these 37 slide samples were not a true random sample of all North Americans, but a sample of patients who volunteered to be part of the study at the University of Wisconsin hospitals. Subjects in medical studies are rarely true random samples from the general population. We cannot be certain that these results hold for a larger population of people. However, it seems reasonable for researchers to believe that cancer cells from patients in Wisconsin are similar to cancer cells from other patients in other hospitals. Thus, we can cautiously conclude that this study provides some evidence that the different nucleus shapes are associated with different proportions of malignant cells.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">6.8</span> <strong>Relative Risk and the Odds Ratio</strong><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#relative-risk-and-the-odds-ratio"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The <strong>proportion</strong> of malignant nuclei in this study is 24/37 = 0.6486. This overall proportion of malignancy is often called the <strong>risk</strong> (or baseline risk) of malignancy. The <strong>conditional proportion</strong> is the proportion of malignant cells calculated for each cell shape. Thus, the round nuclei have a conditional proportion (of malignancy) = 7/16 = 0.4375, and the concave cells have a conditional proportion (of malignancy) = 17/21 = 0.8095.</p>
<p>The hypothesis tests in this chapter have focused on determining whether concave and round nuclei have the same proportion of malignancy. However, it is important to recognize that there are limitations in testing for differences in proportions. For example, assume that we have two studies. In the first study,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\hat p_1 - \hat p_2 &amp;= 0.52 - 0.48 = 0.04
\notag
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>In the second study,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\hat p_1 - \hat p_2 &amp;= 0.05 - 0.01 = 0.04
\notag
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>Both studies could test whether an observed difference in proportions of 0.04 is significant. However, in the second study <em><span class="math inline">\(\hat p_1\)</span></em> is five times larger than <em><span class="math inline">\(\hat p_2\)</span></em>.</p>
<p>An alternative calculation that is commonly used for data with categorical response and explanatory variables is the relative risk. In the following calculations, we arbitrarily decided to define a malignant cell as a success.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\text{Relative risk} &amp;= \frac{\text{proportion of successes in group 1}}{\text{proportion of successes in group 2}} = \frac{\hat p_1}{\hat p_2} \tag{6.4}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>In the cancer cell study, the relative risk is 0.8095/0.4375 = 1.85. Thus, the risk of malignancy is 1.85 times greater for the concave group than for the round group.</p>
<p>The <strong>odds</strong> (more specifically, odds of success) can also be used to compare proportions and tend to have meaning over a broader range of potential outcomes.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\text{Odds} &amp;= \frac{\text{number of successes}}{\text{number of failures}} \tag{6.5}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>The odds of malignancy in the concave group are 17 to 4, meaning that we expect 17 successes (malignant cells) for every 4 failures (benign cells). This is often stated as follows: The odds of malignancy in the concave group are 4.25 (17 ÷ 4) to 1 (4 ÷ 4). The odds of malignancy in the round group are 7 to 9. The <strong>odds ratio</strong> is used to compare the odds of two groups.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\text{Odds ratio} &amp;= \frac{\text{odds of group 1}}{\text{odds of group 2}} = \frac{\hat\theta_1}{\hat\theta_2} \tag{6.6}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>The odds ratio in the cancer cell study is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{17/4}{7/9} = 5.5.\)</span>. Thus, the odds of malignancy are 5.5 times greater for the concave group than for the round group. When the odds ratio = 1, the odds for both groups are equal.</p>
<p><br>
In relative risk and odds ratio calculations, the group that has the lower proportion (or lower odds) is typically considered group 2 (in the denominator). That way, the relative risk and odds ratio are always numbers larger than one and easier to interpret.<br></p>

</h2>
<p>Contingency tables are widely used and easy to interpret. However, it is important to recognize that the appropriate statistical analysis cannot be determined simply by looking at a table of data; it is determined by how the data were collected. While there are numerous ways to collect data, this section will focus on three key sampling designs often used in observational studies.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In <strong>cross‑classification studies</strong>, information is collected simultaneously on both variables in the study. This often occurs when all data are collected from one sample and then placed into a classification table. The row totals and the column totals are not known prior to the data collection. The total sample size, N, may or may not be known before the data are collected.<br>
</li>
<li>In <strong>cohort studies</strong>, individuals (or units) who differ with respect to a certain explanatory variable are selected (or assigned to groups) and then a response variable is measured. These predetermined groups are called cohorts, and if the response variable is measured over time the design is called a prospective design.* In cohort studies, the totals corresponding to the explanatory variable are known before the responses are collected.<br>
</li>
<li>In <strong>case‑control studies</strong>, individuals (or units) are selected according to a response variable (and often called the cases and the controls). Then the individuals are classified according to some explanatory variable. Case‑control studies are often retrospective studies, since historical data are typically used to collect information on the explanatory variable. In case‑control studies, the totals corresponding to the response variable are known before data are collected on the explanatory variable.</li>
</ol>
<p>Prospective studies typically provide stronger evidence of a relationship between the explanatory variable and the response variable. However, they tend to be expensive, to require a long time to gather data, and to be sensitive to attrition. When responses can be rare, such as getting lung cancer, case‑control studies are preferred over cohort studies because case‑control studies can ensure a large enough sample size within each group of responses. However, when data are selected based on the response variable, such as in case‑control studies, studies can be particularly susceptible to difficulties with confounding.</p>

<p>In a retrospective study of lung cancer patients in 20 London hospitals, Richard Doll identified a relationship between smoking and lung cancer.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Retrospective cohort studies also exist. In these designs, past (medical) records are often used to collect data. As with prospective cohort studies, the objective is to first establish groups based on an explanatory variable. However, since these are past records data on the response variable can be collected at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> Table 6.5 shows a partial set of data from his study. The data were collected on 60 female patients with lung cancer and 60 control females.</p>
<ol start="28" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the proportion of females in this study who have lung cancer? What is the proportion of smokers who got lung cancer? What is the proportion of nonsmokers who got lung cancer? What is the relative risk when having lung cancer is defined as a success?<br>
</li>
<li>Notice that Doll predetermined the distribution of the response variable (this is done in case‑control studies). Explain why each of the proportions in Question 28 cannot appropriately be extended to a larger population. (Hint: Is it appropriate to conclude that 60/120 = 50% of female patients in the 20 London hospitals have lung cancer? Is it appropriate to assume that a good estimate of the percentage of female nonsmoking patients in the hospitals who have lung cancer is 37.2%?)</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that tests for equal proportions are not appropriate if the response totals are fixed prior to the study. In addition, the next section will show that since the response totals are not random, a test of independence should not be used. Fisher’s exact test and a simulation study could be used. The following questions will show why it is appropriate to conduct a hypothesis test about the odds ratio.</p>

<h2>Tests for the Homogeneity of Odds<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#tests-for-the-homogeneity-of-odds"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Questions 28–31 showed that when the response variable totals are fixed before the study is conducted, the proportions are not representative of a larger population. Thus, tests for the homogeneity of proportions are not appropriate. This section shows the steps in a test for the homogeneity of odds using the data in Table 6.5.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses:</strong></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
H_0: \frac{\theta_S}{\theta_N} &amp;= 1 \notag \\
H_a: \frac{\theta_S}{\theta_N} &amp;&gt; 1 \notag
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Calculate the test statistic:</strong></p>
<p>We calculate the odds of cancer for the smoking group to be</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\hat\theta_S = \frac{\hat p_S}{1 - \hat p_S} = 1.46 \notag
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>Similarly, the odds of cancer for the nonsmoking group are</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\hat\theta_N = \frac{\hat p_N}{1 - \hat p_N} = 0.594 \notag
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>The odds ratio is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\hat\theta_S}{\hat\theta_N} = 2.466.\)</span></p>
<p>It can be shown (in more advanced texts) that when sample sizes are large, the natural log of the odds ratio is approximately normal with the following standard deviation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
S_{LO}
&amp;= \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_S\,\hat p\,(1 - \hat p)} + \frac{1}{n_N\,\hat p\,(1 - \hat p)}}
= \sqrt{\frac{1}{69(0.5)(0.5)} + \frac{1}{51(0.5)(0.5)}} = 0.3693
\notag
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(n_S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_N\)</span> are the total number of smokers and the total number of nonsmokers in the study, respectively, and <span class="math inline">\(\hat p\)</span> is the overall proportion of people with lung cancer in the study. Also recall that testing whether <span class="math inline">\(\theta_S/\theta_N = 1\)</span> is equivalent to testing whether <span class="math inline">\(\ln(\theta_S/\theta_N) = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus, a test statistic is calculated as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
Z
&amp;= \frac{\ln\bigl(\hat\theta_S / \hat\theta_N\bigr) - 0}{S_{LO}}
= \frac{0.90266}{0.3693} = 2.44 \notag
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Calculate the p-value:</strong></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
P(Z &gt; 2.44) = 0.0073
\notag
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Check model assumptions:</strong></p>
<p>It is reasonable to assume that each patient in the study is independent of the others. A general rule is that as long as the sample size in each cell is greater than or equal to 5, the normality assumption is appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Draw conclusions within the context of the study:</strong></p>
<p>In this study, the small p-value leads us to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the odds ratio is greater than one. In other words, if the population odds of cancer were identical for both smokers and nonsmokers, a sample odds ratio as large or larger than 2.466 was very unlikely to occur by random chance. This study is not an experiment; thus, it is inappropriate to conclude that smoking causes larger odds of cancer. This is not a true random sample of patients in the 20 London hospitals. However, it is reasonable to cautiously expect that these patients are representative of all hospital patients in the 20 London hospitals.</p>

</h2>
<p>The calculations involved in the tests of homogeneity and independence are identical; however the type of question asked will impact the conclusions that can be drawn.</p>
<p>The <strong>test of homogeneity</strong> is used to determine if proportions are equal across two or more populations. The hypothesis test related to the cancer cell study</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
H_0: p_L &amp;= p_H \notag \\
H_a: p_L &amp;\neq p_H \notag
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>fits this situation. Tests of homogeneity are appropriate whenever one of the variables is clearly defined as the response variable. As shown in the previous section, a test of homogeneity of proportions is not acceptable when the response totals are known in advance. However, a test of the homogeneity of odds is appropriate even if the response totals are fixed.</p>
<p>The <strong>test of independence</strong> is used to determine if two random variables within a population are independent. It is not necessary to determine which variable is the explanatory variable and which is the response variable. If any of the marginal (i.e., row or column) totals are known (fixed) in advance, at least one of the variables is not random, and thus the test of independence is not appropriate. The null and alternative hypotheses can be written as</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Tests of homogeneity and independence are not restricted to chi-square tests. For example, the two-proportion z-test is also a test of homogeneity.
</p>
<p>In both tests, the null hypothesis is that there is no relationship between the row variable and the column variable. Tests of independence are essentially testing if the probability of a success for one variable depends on the value of a second variable. They are appropriate whenever both the row and the column variables are random (e.g., the column totals are not predetermined by the researcher), as in cross-classification studies.</p>
<p>Tests of homogeneity are appropriate whenever it is clear that one variable should be treated as the response and the other as the explanatory variable. Thus, tests of homogeneity can be used with all three study designs listed earlier. However, case-control study designs (where the response totals are fixed) are appropriate only for testing homogeneity of odds (not homogeneity of proportions). Table 6.6 summarizes the appropriate hypothesis tests for each sampling design. Specific examples of each type of sampling design are provided in the end-of-chapter exercises.</p>
<p>In the cancer cells study, we concluded that different cell nucleus shapes are associated with different
proportions of malignant cells. In this study, the researchers had a clear explanatory variable (<span class="math inline">\(Shape\)</span>) and
response variable (<span class="math inline">\(Type\)</span>). Thus, the test of homogeneity is appropriate. However, a test of independence is
also appropriate, since each subject was selected from one larger population: patients with suspicious tumors
at the University of Wisconsin hospitals. After the patients were selected, the biopsy and FNA were conducted
and each observed slide was classified as either malignant or benign and either round or concave.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>While the chi-square test of independence is frequently used, the conclusions from this test are not very
informative. The test does not prove that two variables are independent, but only identifies that we have
significant evidence that two variables are dependent. No measurement of the degree of independence (or
indication of whether this level of dependence is of practical importance) is given.</p>

</h2>
<p>Many statistical techniques are based on specific model assumptions. For example, many procedures discussed throughout this text for calculating hypothesis tests and confidence intervals assume that the error terms follow a normal distribution. If the model assumptions are violated, the tests should not be considered reliable.</p>
<p>Goodness-of-fit tests are used to determine how well our observed data “fit” the model assumptions. In other words, we want to determine how “close” the observed values are to those values that we would expect under a specific (theoretical) distribution.</p>
<p>Before a goodness-of-fit test can be used, we need some prior knowledge (or benchmark values) about a theoretical model. The chi-square goodness-of-fit test is applied to data that are placed into groups. Sample data are placed into classes (observed groups), and a theoretical model is used to calculate the expected number of observations in each group. In this section, we will use goodness-of-fit tests to determine if the observed counts (or proportions) are consistent with hypothetical counts (or proportions).</p>

<h2>Extended Activity: Playing a Dice Game<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#extended-activity-playing-a-dice-game"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Your friend offers to play a simple game with you. He has a six‑sided die and will roll it 30 times. Each time he rolls a 5 or 6, you will pay him $5. Each time he rolls a 1, 2, 3, or 4, he will pay you $5. The results of your friend’s 30 rolls for this game are shown in Table 6.7.</p>
<p>If you had agreed to play this game, you would have owed your friend some money. Table 6.7 is called a one-way table with six cells. We can consider these results a random sample from all possible rolls of this die, and we can assume that each roll is independent. If the die was fair, we would assume (our null hypothesis would be) that each of the six outcomes was equally likely.</p>
<ol start="32" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>From visual inspection of the results, do you have any reason to suspect the die wasn’t fair? Explain.<br>
</li>
<li>In this example, there are <em>G</em> = 6 groups (cells). Assuming the die is fair, the probability that a roll results in a 1 is <span class="math inline">\(p_1 = 1/6\)</span>, the probability that a roll results in a 2 is <span class="math inline">\(p_2 = 1/6\)</span>, etc. In goodness-of-fit tests, the expected values are found from some hypothesized distribution that determines the probability for each of the <em>G</em> groups.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this case, we assume <span class="math inline">\(p_1 = p_2 = p_3 = p_4 = p_5 = p_6 = 1/6\)</span>. The expected count for each of the 6 groups can be found from <em>n</em> × <em>p</em><sub>i</sub>. Assuming all outcomes are equally likely, fill out the expected counts in Table 6.8.</p>
<ol start="34" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Conduct a chi-square test to determine if there is a significant difference between what was observed and what was expected.<br>

The chi-square goodness-of-fit test is applied to grouped data (i.e., data put into classes). Continuous data can easily be placed into groups. However, it is important to recognize that the value of the chi-square test statistic depends on how the data are grouped.

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">6.12</span> <strong>Chapter Summary</strong><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#chapter-summary-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>This chapter focused on analyzing and drawing conclusions from categorical data. Fisher’s exact test, simulation studies, and chi-square tests were used to analyze various data sets. Like most hypothesis tests, each of these tests is valid only if care is taken to ensure that the appropriate assumptions are met. All tests assume that the observations are independent.</p>
<p><strong>Fisher’s exact test</strong> is appropriate for any sample size and any sampling design involving 2 × 2 contingency tables. <strong>Simulation studies</strong> are used to approximate Fisher’s exact test. While simulation studies are approximate, conducting 10,000 iterations will typically provide precise p‑values.</p>
<p>Simulation studies have the advantage of being very adaptable. For example, they can easily be modified to any number of categories within a study. (The research project at the end of the chapter provides an example of a simulation study where the independent observation assumption is violated.)</p>
<p>When sample sizes are large enough, the chi-square test statistic will follow the chi-square distribution. In order for the p‑values from <strong>chi-square tests</strong> to be appropriate, the following conditions should be satisfied:</p>
<ul>
<li>For 2 × 2 contingency tables, the sample size should be large enough that the expected count in each cell of the table is at least 5.</li>
<li>For tables with more than two rows or two columns, all expected counts should be greater than 1 and the average expected count should be greater than or equal to 5.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chi-square tests are always two‑sided hypothesis tests. However, they can be easily extended to contingency tables with more than two rows and two columns. If there are more than two rows and two columns, the chi-square test does not specifically test the significance of each cell. However, the end‑of‑chapter exercises show that it is reasonable to look at each cell’s contribution to the chi-square statistic.</p>
<p>Three key sampling designs were described in this chapter.</p>
<ul>
<li>In a <strong>cross-classified design</strong>, information is collected simultaneously on both variables in the study. The row totals and the column totals are not known prior to the data collection.</li>
<li>In <strong>cohort studies</strong>, the totals corresponding to the explanatory variable are known before the responses are collected.</li>
<li>In <strong>case-control studies</strong>, the totals corresponding to the response variable are known before data are collected on the explanatory variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Testing the <strong>equivalence of two proportions</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(H_0: p_1 = p_2\)</span>) is mathematically equivalent to testing whether the <strong>odds ratio</strong> is equal to 1 (<span class="math inline">\(H_0: \theta_1/\theta_2 = 1\)</span>), where <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> represents the proportion successful and <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> represents the odds of success for any two groups (labeled 1 and 2). However, when the proportions of interest are very small, it may be more appropriate to look at the odds ratio than at the proportions. Tests for equal proportions are not appropriate for case-control studies, because the fixed response totals cause the sample proportions to not accurately represent the population.</p>
<p>Chi-square tests for homogeneity and independence involve exactly the same mathematical calculations; however, the hypotheses and conclusions are different. A <strong>test of homogeneity of proportions</strong> is appropriate whenever the explanatory and response variables are clearly defined from the beginning of the study. While the explanatory totals may be known in advance, the response totals cannot be fixed before the data are collected. <strong>Tests of independence</strong> are appropriate if one sample is selected from one population, and thus neither explanatory nor response totals are known in advance (i.e., both explanatory and response totals can be considered random).</p>
<p>This chapter was limited to studies involving only one categorical explanatory variable and one categorical response variable. Additional tests such as the Mantel–Haenszel procedure can be used to test for equal proportions or odds with two explanatory variables. The following chapters discuss more general procedures, using logistic and Poisson regression to analyze data with a categorical response variable and multiple categorical or quantitative explanatory variables.</p>
