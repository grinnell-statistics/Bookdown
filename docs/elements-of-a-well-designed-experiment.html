<p>Unfortunately, many people mistakenly believe that statistics is only a process of performing mathematical
calculations on data in order to examine the validity of a hypothesis. Proper experimental design is just as
important as, if not more important than, the choice of statistical calculations. In fact, designing experi-
ments and collecting appropriate data are often the most difficult and time-consuming aspects of conducting
experiments.</p>
<p>KEY CONCEPT<br>
A good design attempts to answer the question(s) of interest as clearly and efficiently as possible. Any
statistical analysis is only as good as the quality of the data.</p>
<p>An <strong>experiment</strong> is defined as a study in which purposeful changes are made to controlled conditions in
order to identify changes in a response. An experiment imposes a treatment on subjects or experimental units,
while an <strong>observational study</strong> simply collects data under varying conditions without imposing any changes.</p>
<p>Well-designed experiments are conducted under controlled conditions to make it easier to isolate the impact
of each treatment combination. In observational studies, the conditions in the study are rarely the only char-
acteristic that makes the two (or more) populations different. Thus, unknown factors that may bias the results
are unfortunately built into an observational study.</p>
<p>KEY CONCEPT<br>
Both experiments and observational studies use sample data to draw conclusions about a larger
population, process, or system. It is often much easier to show cause and effect relationships in a
well-designed experiment because conditions are controlled.</p>
<p>NOTE
Some texts state that only experiments can be used to show cause and effect relationships. However, poorly
designed experiments should not be used to show causation. In addition, observational studies (such as
those testing a relationship between smoking and lung cancer) can be used to show causation if (1) there is
a strong association between the explanatory and response variables, (2) higher doses are associated with
stronger responses (e.g., more cigarettes increase the likelihood of getting cancer), (3) there are consistent
results across many studies, and (4) there are credible explanations for the cause and effect relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental design</strong> is the process of planning an experiment that collects the right amount and type
of data to answer a question of interest. Several decisions need to be made about how an experiment is to be
constructed and executed to ensure that the experimental results are valid. Taking the time to properly design
an experiment will improve the precision of answers to research questions. In addition, well-designed experi-
ments often are much more efficient and obtain stronger conclusions than other studies.</p>
<p>The first step in designing an experiment is to clearly define a problem and state the objectives of the
experiment. This is often much more difficult than it first appears. Before any data are collected, it is essential
that everyone involved understand the objectives of the experiment, what measurements will be taken, what
material is needed, and what procedures will be used. Good experimental design typically involves gaining
background knowledge outside the field of statistics.</p>
<p>There are many possible ways to conduct an experiment to determine the effect of brand on the quality
of popcorn. While microwave popcorn is something these students were quite familiar with, they needed to
determine which brands to compare, the appropriate cooking time (which could vary by microwave), and how
to define and measure “good” popcorn.</p>
<div id="identifying-a-response-variable" class="section level2" number="6.1">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Identifying a Response Variable<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#identifying-a-response-variable"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Many possible measurements could be taken on microwave popcorn. Yvonne and Tue could have created a
taste rating or a texture rating, measured the volume of the kernels, counted the number of popped kernels, or
calculated the percentage of “old maids,” the kernels that did not pop after the bag had been cooked.</p>
<p>Identifying the response variable corresponds to determining what measurements should be taken. Each
experiment should ensure that the response variable provides the information needed and that the response
measurement is precise enough to address the question of interest. Yvonne and Tue determined that their
definition of “quality” popcorn would be popcorn that had the highest percentage of popped kernels per bag.
Notice that if Yvonne and Tue had counted only the popped kernels, and not the unpopped kernels, they might
have gotten a distorted response, since some brands may tend to have more kernels per bag.</p>
<p>Yvonne and Tue initially discussed randomly sampling 20 kernels from each popped bag and calculating the percentage of popped kernels. However, the size and shape differences between popped and
un-popped kernels would have made it rather difficult to simply pull out a random sample. Thus, in order
to ensure their counts were as accurate as possible, they decided to count every kernel in every bag of their
experiment.</p>
<p>It is also useful to discuss the range and variability of responses expected to be observed. For example,
if we conducted a study under conditions that typically gave only two outcomes, either 0% or 100%, the
response would be categorical (such as yes/no or popped/not popped), and then an analysis based on cat-
egorical response variables should be used. Studies with categorical response variables can be analyzed
with techniques such as the chi-square test or logistic regression, which are discussed in Chapters 6 and 7,
respectively.</p>
<p>The percentage of popped kernels was considered a quantitative response variable in this experiment.
Background research showed that some popcorn companies expected between 94% and 97% popped kernels,
but based on their prior popctorn eating experience, Yvonne and Tue expected the percentage to be a little
lower. In Yvonne and Tue’s study, they roughly estimated that responses should be between 60% and 99%
popped kernels, with an average close to 90%.</p>
<p>KEY CONCEPT<br>
Care needs to be taken before a study is conducted to ensure that the response measurement is accu-
rate and applicable to the research question.</p>
</div>
<div id="identifying-the-factors-and-levels" class="section level2" number="6.2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Identifying the Factors and Levels<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#identifying-the-factors-and-levels"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The next step in designing an experiment is to investigate any factors that may be of importance or may
potentially bias the results. Yvonne and Tue had two microwaves that they typically used to make popcorn,
one in their dorm lounge and one in their room. The lounge microwave had a “popcorn” setting, which cooked
for 1 minute 45 seconds, though the package instructions for each brand suggested varying cooking times.
Most microwaves also have power settings. Should popcorn always be popped at the highest power setting?</p>
<p>With a little research, these students found that the quality of popcorn can also be affected by how it is
stored. Popcorn stored in a moisture-rich environment, such as a refrigerator, tends to have a higher percentage
of popped kernels. However, too much moisture may cause the popcorn to have a gummy texture. Finally,
Yvonne and Tue wanted to compare a relatively expensive brand of popcorn (Pop Secret) to a relatively
inexpensive brand (Fastco). Each of these brands also has a variety of flavors, such as butter, kettle corn, and
caramel.</p>
<p>Notice that the discussion of factors and potential levels is based not on statistical calculations, but on
nonstatistical knowledge. Nonstatistical knowledge is often essential in choosing factors, determining factor
levels, and interpreting the results of a study.</p>
<p>Yvonne and Tue decided on three factors of interest, factors that would be included in the study to
determine if different levels impact the results:<br>
Factor 1: popcorn Brand at two levels, Fastco and Pop Secret<br>
Factor 2: Microwave at two levels, Lounge and Room<br>
Factor 3: cooking Time at two levels, 105 seconds and 135 seconds</p>
<p>It can sometimes be difficult to identify a reasonable range for each factor. Yvonne and Tue had noticed
that some brands of popcorn tended to burn at around 150 seconds (2.5 minutes). Even though cooking pop-
corn longer than 135 seconds might increase the percentage of popped kernels, Yvonne and Tue decided to
avoid cooking times likely to cause burning.</p>
<p>Yvonne and Tue then listed suspected extraneous variables, other factors that need to be controlled
during the experiment to eliminate potential biases. Yvonne and Tue decided to hold some extraneous vari-
ables constant. In particular, they used only the highest power setting on each microwave, they stored all
the popcorn on a shelf in their room, and they used only the butter flavor of each brand. There were other
variables they could not control, such as age of the popcorn, which manufacturing plant prepared each bag
of popcorn, and how different retail stores had stored the popcorn. To account for the extraneous variables
they could not control (or had not even thought of ), it would be best to randomly select bags of popcorn from
the entire population. Instead, Yvonne and Tue did their best to randomly select several bags of Fastco and
Pop Secret butter popcorn from a variety of stores in town. This was not a true random sample, and Yvonne
and Tue had to be careful in making any statements about how the results of their study extended to a larger
population. In addition, when possible, each bag of popcorn in the study was randomly allocated to a factor-
level combination. While bags of popcorn can be randomly assigned to a cooking time and microwave, they
cannot be randomly assigned to a popcorn brand.</p>
<p>KEY CONCEPT<br>
A good design controls for known extraneous variables (often by holding them constant throughout
the study) and then uses random sampling and random allocation to control for any other unknown or
uncontrollable extraneous variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="choosing-a-design" class="section level2" number="6.3">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Choosing a Design<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#choosing-a-design"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In addition to determining what conditions to test and what measurements to take, in order to create a good
experimental design, a researcher must properly define units and determine how units are structured. An
experimental unit is the smallest part of experimental material that is assigned (randomly, if possible) to a
factor-level combination within a study. Since Yvonne and Tue counted every kernel of popcorn, some may
incorrectly assume that each kernel is a unit. In an experiment, units are randomly assigned to treatments.
In this study, each kernel was not randomly assigned to a condition, but each bag of popcorn was randomly
assigned to be popped in a particular microwave for a particular length of time. Thus, bags of popcorn are
considered the units for Yvonne and Tue’s study.</p>
<p>KEY CONCEPT<br>
If (1) units are as similar as possible, (2) units are randomly assigned to treatment combinations, and
(3) large enough sample sizes are used, then we can conclude that statistically significant differences
in the response can be explained by the different treatment combinations.</p>
<p>This chapter will focus on <strong>completely randomized factorial designs</strong>. In completely randomized designs,
each unit is assigned to exactly one factor-level combination. Only one measurement is collected for each
unit. In the following section, we will use Yvonne and Tue’s data to simultaneously test for the effects of two
brands, two cooking times, and two microwaves on the percentage of popped kernels.</p>
<p>NOTE<br>
While this chapter focuses only on completely randomized factorial designs, it is important to recognize
the difference between completely randomized, <strong>block</strong> and <strong>split-plot</strong> or <strong>(repeated measures) designs</strong>.
If each unit is assigned to only one factor-level combination, it is appropriate to use a completely rand-
omized design. If each unit is assigned to several conditions or multiple measurements are taken on each
unit, a more complex design structure, such as a block or split-plot (repeated measures) design, may be
needed.
Block and split-plot (repeated measures) designs also work with different types of factors. The factors
of interest in this chapter all have fixed effects. <strong>Fixed effects</strong> correspond to factors where each level is
selected because it is of specific interest to the researcher. <strong>Random effects</strong> correspond to factors where
the levels are randomly selected from a larger population. All factors in a completely randomized design
are also <strong>crossed</strong>; this means that every level of each factor can be tested in combination with every
level of every other factor. Alternatively, <strong>nested factors</strong> are factors for which some levels cannot occur
simultaneously with other factor levels. Random effects and nested factors can be analyzed with block
and split-plot (repeated measures) designs; they are described in Chapter 5.</p>
<p>KEY CONCEPT<br>
If possible, a straightforward design and analysis are usually better than a complex design and analy-
sis. If the design is too complicated and the data are not collected properly, even the most advanced
statistical techniques may not be able to draw appropriate conclusions from an experiment.</p>

</h2>
<p>When more units are tested, it is more likely that the statistical analysis will identify true differences between
conditions. However, every unit tested has a cost, and it is important to carefully determine how many units are
practical to test. Is it worth testing additional units to gain a better understanding of the unit-to-unit variability?</p>
<p>Yvonne and Tue estimated that they could each count the kernels in one bag (popped and unpopped) in
10 to 15 minutes. They also thought that they could get a few close friends to count a few bags in exchange
for free popcorn. Care should always be taken when measuring results. If the result is a subjective measure-
ment (such as the taste of popcorn or the quality of artwork), very clear procedures should be written and, if
possible, the same people should record each measurement. In this popcorn study, counting the percentage of
popped kernels per bag is an objective measurement. As long as Yvonne and Tue have trustworthy friends,
there should be no problem in having several people help count popcorn kernels.* They estimated that they
could conduct 32 tests in about four hours.</p>
<p>The choice of 32 tests, instead of a round number like 30, is also related to a well-designed experiment.
Yvonne and Tue found that, based on their choice of factors and levels, there were a total of eight treatment
combinations. Table 4.1 lists the eight possible treatment conditions that can be “assigned” to each bag of
popcorn. Yvonne and Tue wanted to have a balanced design, a design where the same number of units is
assigned to (or randomly selected from) each condition. Balanced designs are often easier to analyze and more
likely to identify true differences in the effects of different conditions.3 If Yvonne and Tue wanted to conduct
a balanced design, they needed to conduct tests in a multiple of 8 (16, 24, etc.).</p>

<p>MATHEMATICAL NOTE<br>
Table 4.1 lists the variables in standard order. Listing conditions in <strong>standard order</strong> is a simple technique
that ensures that each factor combination is listed exactly once. The first variable alternates levels every
row. For the second variable, levels alternate every other row. The third variable alternates every fourth
row. This same process can work for multiple factors with multiple levels. If there were four factors, each
with two levels, the fourth column would alternate every eight rows. For studies with more than two levels,
simply ensure that the current variable lists each level exactly once for all prior combinations</p>

<p>Since several factors are included in this experiment, there are also several hypotheses to be tested. Yvonne and Tue actually had six research questions, which will be discussed in Section 4.4. But to keep the calculations simple, in this section we will assume that only two factors were tested (<em>Brand</em> and <em>Time</em>). This leads to three hypotheses corresponding to the <em>Brand</em> and <em>Time</em> factors:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(H_{01}: \mu_{\text{Fastco}} = \mu_{\text{PopSecret}}\)</span>, there is no difference in the mean response (<em>PopRate</em>) between the two <em>Brands</em>.

<p>Factorial designs are efficient because much more information can be calculated, such as p-values for
multiple hypothesis tests, without requiring more experimental units than for the typical two-sample t-test.
Factorial designs are very beneficial in situations where experimental units are expensive or difficult to obtain.
The next sections will discuss how to organize and draw conclusions for each of the above hypotheses in a
factorial design with two factors, also called a <strong>two-way factorial design</strong>.</p>

<p>MATHEMATICAL NOTE<br>
The dot in the subscript indicates that the average was taken over all values of that subscript. The key is to recognize that groups are identified by their subscripts. Brand is the first subscript, and Time is the second. Each individual observation for each Brand and Time factor-level combination is represented by the third subscript. For example, the 4th observation in Table 4.2 for the Fastco brand (brand 1) and the 135-second time (time 2) group is <span class="math inline">\(y_{1,2,4} = 71.50\)</span>. The average of the 8 observations in the Fastco brand (brand 1) and 135-second time group is represented by <span class="math inline">\(\bar y_{1,2,.} = 82.38\)</span>. In addition, <span class="math inline">\(\bar y_{1..}\)</span> is the average response of all 16 of the Fastco brand (brand 1 observations), while <span class="math inline">\(\bar y_{.1.}\)</span> is the average response of all 16 of the 105-second times (time 1 observations). <span class="math inline">\(\bar y_{...}\)</span> is the overall average PopRate, averaged over all observations for both Brand and cooking time. That is, <span class="math inline">\(\bar y_{...}\)</span> is the overall average PopRate.</p>

<p>Figure 4.1 and Table 4.3 indicate that the difference between the <em>Time</em> means is much larger than the difference between the <em>Brand</em> means. In addition, the difference between <em>Time</em> means is much larger for the Pop Secret brand than for the Fastco brand. In this section, we will conduct an analysis, called analysis of variance, to find p-values for testing each of the three hypotheses stated earlier about the underlying mean responses.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis of variance (ANOVA)</strong> is conducted by comparing the variability between groups to the variability within groups. For example, does the variability between Brand means (between groups) appear to be large compared to the variation of responses within the two Brand levels (within groups)? In ANOVA, these measures of variability are called mean squares. For example, the variability between brands is called mean square brand and is denoted <span class="math inline">\(MS_{Brand}\)</span>. In actual practice, the following ANOVA calculations are done
with computer software instead of by hand. The reason for working through these equations in detail is to
better illustrate the logic behind using ANOVA to determine if between group variability is significant (i.e.,
to determine whether we can reject any of the null hypotheses).</p>
<p><strong>Between-Group Variability</strong> To create a measure of the variability between Brand means (<span class="math inline">\(MS_{Brand}\)</span>), calculate the weighted variance of the Brand group means, using the size of each group as the weight. The weighted variance of the Brand group means is calculated with the following equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\mathrm{MS}_{\mathrm{Brand}}
= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^2 n_{i.} \times (\bar y_{i..} - \bar y_{...})^2}{2 - 1}
= \frac{16\times(81.8 - 81.3)^2 + 16\times(80.9 - 81.3)^2}{2 - 1}
\tag{4.1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(n_{i.}\)</span> is the number of observations for brand <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. In this study, <span class="math inline">\(n_{i.} = 16\)</span>. Notice that Equation (4.1) looks similar to a typical variance calculation:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\bullet\)</span> There are two observed group means: 81.8 and 80.9.<br><span class="math inline">\(\bullet\)</span> The spread is measured by summing the squared distance between each observed group mean and the overall mean and then dividing by the number of group means minus one.</p>
<p>As with any variance calculation, we are finding an average squared distance (mean squared distance,
denoted <span class="math inline">\(MS_{Brand}\)</span>). The difference between this calculation and a typical variance calculation is the use of weights:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\bullet\)</span> Each observed mean is based on a group of size 16; this group sample size (<span class="math inline">\(n_{i.} = 16\)</span>) is multiplied
by each squared distance.</p>
<p>MATHEMATICAL NOTE<br>
In our study, we have a balanced design (equal sample sizes). However, the formulas allow for unbalanced designs.</p>
<p>The calculation of the variability between the Time means (<span class="math inline">\(MS_{Time}\)</span>) is very similar to Equation (4.1):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\mathrm{MS}_{\mathrm{Time}}
= \frac{\sum_{j=1}^2 n_{.j} \times (\bar y_{.j.} - \bar y_{...})^2}{2 - 1}
\tag{4.2}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The first two hypotheses at the beginning of this section correspond to questions about main factors
incorporated into the experiment, Brand and Time. The third hypothesis focuses on whether the impact of
one variable (Time) depends on a second variable (Brand). This is called an <strong>interaction effect</strong>.</p>
<p>Table 4.3 provides some evidence of interaction between Brand and Time. For the Fastco brand popcorn,
the longer cooking time increases the percentage of popped kernels by <span class="math inline">\(\bar y_{12.}\)</span> - <span class="math inline">\(\bar y_{11.}\)</span> = 82.38 - 81.13 = 1.25,
while the increase for the Pop Secret brand is many times larger: <span class="math inline">\(\bar y_{22.}\)</span> - <span class="math inline">\(\bar y_{21.}\)</span> = 86.42 - 75.44 = 10.98.</p>
<p>To test for an interaction effect (the third hypothesis), we first measure the variability between all four
groups (each Brand and Time combination) and then subtract the squared values for the main factors.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\mathrm{MS}_{\mathrm{Brand}\times\mathrm{Time}}
= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^2 \sum_{j=1}^2 n_{ij}(\bar y_{ij\,.} - \bar y_{..})^2
    - \sum_{i=1}^2 n_{i.}(\bar y_{i..} - \bar y_{...})^2
    - \sum_{j=1}^2 n_{.j}(\bar y_{.j.} - \bar y_{...})^2}
{4 - 1 - 1 - 1}
\tag{4.3}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The key aspect of Equation (4.3) is that it calculates the squared distance between the four factor-level
group means and the overall mean after accounting for the main factor group means. Thus, this calculation is an
estimate of how spread out the four group means are after accounting for any influence of the main factor means.</p>
<p>The denominator of the mean square for interaction is based on the denominators from <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MS}_{\mathrm{Brand}}\)</span> in Equation
(4.1) and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MS}_{\mathrm{Time}}\)</span> in Equation (4.2). In this example, there are four factor-level group means. Thus, the denomina-
tor is calculated as 4 - 1- (denominator from <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MS}_{\mathrm{Brand}}\)</span>) - (denominator from <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MS}_{\mathrm{Time}}\)</span>) = 4 - 1 - 1 - 1.
Details for deriving mean squares are provided in the extended activities.</p>
<p>KEY CONCEPT<br>
The interaction term is not simply a measure of the spread between the four factor-level group means.
It measures the remaining spread of the means after adjusting for differences between the main factor
means.</p>
<p><strong>Within-Group Variability</strong> The best estimate of the variability within each group (MSE) is simply a
weighted average of the sample variances within each of the four factor-level groups:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\mathrm{MSE}
= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^2 \sum_{j=1}^2 (n_{ij} - 1)s_{ij}^2}
{(n_{11}-1) + (n_{12}-1) + (n_{21}-1) + (n_{22}-1)}
= \frac{(8-1)s_{11}^2 + (8-1)s_{12}^2 + (8-1)s_{21}^2 + (8-1)s_{22}^2}
{4\times(8-1)}
\tag{4.4}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(s_{ij}^2\)</span> is the sample variance for the group representing brand i and time j. The implicit assumption here is
that the variances of the possible responses with each of the four group populations are all the same, so it makes
sense to “pool” the sample variances into a single estimate of overall response variability. This <strong>equal variance assumption</strong>
is key to the validity of the ANOVA statistical method. If the variability within each group is quite
different, the MSE may not be an appropriate estimate. It is often useful to create individual value plots or side-by-side
boxplots of the groups to check if the spreads of the sample groups are roughly similar.</p>
<p>MATHEMATICAL NOTE<br>
If groups of data from each factor-level combination have very different sample sizes and at least one
group has a small sample size (e.g., less than 5 units per group), then ANOVA may not be appropriate. If
the group(s) with the smallest sample size (s) has an unusually high variance, the MSE is likely to underes-
timate the true variance and ANOVA is likely to incorrectly reject the null hypothesis (conclude that there
are differences when there really are no differences between group means). If the group(s) with the smallest
sample size(s) has an unusually small variance, the MSE is likely to overestimate the true variance. The
larger MSE may cause us to incorrectly fail to reject the null hypothesis (fail to detect true differences).</p>
<p>Equation (4.4) is often called the <strong>mean square error (MSE)</strong> of the responses, because “error” represents the
unit-to-unit variability in the response that can’t be explained by any of the main factors or interactions. We are
now ready to calculate a test statistic corresponding to each of the three hypotheses at the beginning of this section.</p>
<p><strong>The F-Statistic</strong> The F-statistic is a ratio of the between-group variability (variation between factor-level
averages) to the within-group variability (pooled estimate of variability within each factor-level combina-
tion): (MS for factor)/MSE. Mathematical theory proves that if the assumptions of the ANOVA model hold,
the F-statistic follows an F-distribution with degrees of freedom corresponding to the denominators of the
MS for the factor being tested and the MSE. The <strong>p-value</strong> gives the likelihood of observing an F-statistic at
least this large, assuming that the true population factor has equal level means. Thus, when the p-value is
small, we conclude that there is a difference between the level means. Additional details are provided in the
extended activities at the end of the chapter.</p>
<p>KEY CONCEPT<br>
An F-statistic is simply the ratio of between-group variability to within-group variability.</p>

<li><p>Does Figure 4.1 indicate that the spread of each group appears roughly similar, so the equal variance
assumption seems reasonable? Another informal check of the equal variance assumption can
be done by calculating the ratio of the maximum sample standard deviation to the minimum sample

evidence against the equal variance assumption. Compare the standard deviations of the four treat-

<li><p>Create a normal probability plot or histogram of the residuals from Question 13. Does it appear that

</ol>
<p>CAUTION<br>
Some statisticians will reject the equal variance assumption when the ratio of standard deviations is
greater than 3 instead of 2. Others recommend that formal tests be used to test for equal variances.
However, some tests, such as Bartlett’s test, are very sensitive to nonnormality. Box criticized using
Bartlett’s test as a preliminary test for equal variances, saying “To make the preliminary test on variances

<p>In Question 13, the p-value corresponding to the third hypothesis test listed at the beginning of this section
was 0.04. This demonstrates an <strong>interaction</strong>: the effect of one variable (Time) on the response depends on a
second variable (Brand). Figure 4.2 provides a side-by-side boxplot and an interaction plot of the Popcorn
data. An <strong>interaction plot</strong> is simply a plot of the four factor-level group means shown in Table 4.3. These plots
show that for both brands, the average PopRate increases when the cooking time changes from 105 to 135
seconds. However, the change in means for the Fastco brand is very small compared to the change observed
in the Pop Secret brand.</p>
<p>[[[Figure 4.2 goes here]]]</p>
<p>The interaction plot is helpful in visualizing how the effect of one factor can depend on another factor,
especially when there are multiple factors in the study. When the lines in an interaction plot are essentially
parallel, the effect of the first variable is not influenced by a second variable. Nonparallel lines indicate an
interaction between main factors (e.g., the effect of Time depends on Brand). However, the interaction plot
does not show the within group variability, so only the p-value from the ANOVA can be used to determine
if the interaction is significant. The p-value of 0.04 shows that the observed interaction effect is so large that
it is unlikely to have occurred just by chance. We conclude that <span class="math inline">\(H_{a3}\)</span> is true: Brand influences the effect of
Time on PopRate.</p>

<p>One advantage of ANOVA is that the analysis can easily be extended to multiple factors with many levels. In this section, all three factors in the popcorn study (Brand, Time, and Microwave) will be simultaneously examined for their influence on PopRate with a three-way ANOVA (also called a three-
factor ANOVA).</p>
<p>Using only the 32 observations from the Popcorn data, a three-way ANOVA will allow us to simultaneously test the following six hypotheses:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(H_{01}: \mu_{\text{Fastco}} = \mu_{\text{PopSecret}}\)</span><br><span class="math inline">\(H_{a1}: \mu_{\text{Fastco}} \neq \mu_{\text{PopSecret}}\)</span><br>
</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(H_{02}: \mu_{105} = \mu_{135}\)</span><br><span class="math inline">\(H_{a2}: \mu_{105} \neq \mu_{135}\)</span><br>
</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(H_{03}:\)</span> Brand has no influence on how Time affects PopRate<br><span class="math inline">\(H_{a3}:\)</span> there is an interaction between Brand and Time<br>
</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(H_{04}: \mu_{\text{Room}} = \mu_{\text{Lounge}}\)</span><br><span class="math inline">\(H_{a4}: \mu_{\text{Room}} \neq \mu_{\text{Lounge}}\)</span><br>
</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(H_{05}:\)</span> Microwave has no influence on how Brand affects PopRate<br><span class="math inline">\(H_{a5}:\)</span> there is an interaction between Microwave and Brand<br>
</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(H_{06}:\)</span> Microwave has no influence on how Time affects PopRate<br><span class="math inline">\(H_{a6}:\)</span> there is an interaction between Microwave and Time</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE<br>
It is also reasonable to test for a three-way interaction, <span class="math inline">\(H_{a3}\)</span>; the size of the effect of Time for each level of Brand also depends on Microwave. In practice, the three-way interaction effect may be difficult to interpret, and some researchers choose not to include it in their analysis. The impacts of including additional tests are described in Chapter 5.</p>

</li>
<li>Calculate the eight group standard deviations. If the largest standard deviation is no more than two

population of responses within each group. Is it appropriate to assume equal variances in this Popcorn
study?</li>
<li>Use a statistical software package to simultaneously test all six hypotheses given at the beginning of
this section.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Submit the appropriate software output.</li>
<li>Create a normal probability plot (described in Chapter 2) or a histogram of the residuals. Are the
residuals consistent with the assumption of a normal distribution?</li>
<li>Use the p-value corresponding to each hypothesis to state your conclusions.</li>
<li>Address how random sampling and random allocation influence your conclusions.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Determine whether <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MS}_{\mathrm{Brand}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MS}_{\mathrm{Time}}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MS}_{\mathrm{BrandTime}}\)</span> are the same as in Question 13. Explain why these <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-statistics have changed.</li>
</ol>
<p>In completely randomized designs, all F-statistics corresponding to the tests for each main factor and
interaction use the same denominator. The mean square for each main factor (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MS}_{\mathrm{Brand}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MS}_{\mathrm{Time}}\)</span> is a measurement of the variability between level means. Since this is a balanced design, when the level means
for a factor are farther apart, the corresponding mean square and F-statistics are larger. Thus, the main effects
plot shown in Figure 4.3 allows us to quickly see that the Time factor is the most significant (has the smallest
p-value) and the Brand factor is the least significant</p>
<p>[[[Figure 4.3 goes here]]]</p>
<p>Figure 4.3 also provides interaction plots corresponding to the three hypotheses tests about interactions.
Using the same logic, Figure 4.3 shows that the hypothesis test corresponding to the Brand and Time inter-
action will have the smallest p-value. While both the effect of Time and the effect of Brand are somewhat
influenced by Microwave, the effect of Time is most influenced by changing Brand.</p>
